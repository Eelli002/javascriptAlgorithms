Doubly Linked Lists

Objectives
    - Construct a Doubly Linked List
    - Compare and contrast doubly and singly linked Lists
    - Implement basic operations on a Doubly Linked List

We know what lists are... but doubly?
    - Almost identical to Singly Linked Lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node!

Singly Linked List:
14 -> 39 -> 73 -> 36 -> 80 -> 16 -> 28
Head                               Tail

Doubly Linked List:
14 <-> 39 <-> 73 <-> 36 <-> 80 <-> 16 <-> 28
Head                                     Tail

Comparisons with Singly Linked Lists
    - More Memory === More Flexibility
    - It's almost always a tradeoff!
