BubbleSort
    - A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^  ^ Swap them bc 5 is larger than 3
[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]
    ^  ^ Swap them again bc 5 is larger than 4
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
       ^  ^ Swap bc 5 > 1
[3, 4, 1, 5, 2]
          ^  ^ Swap bc 5 > 2
[3, 4, 1, 2, 5]
             ^ 5 is now at the top of the list bc it is the largest.
// We sort the array again but this time we only have 4 items to sort through becasue 5 is already at its correct position.
[3, 4, 1, 2, 5]
 ^  ^ We don't swap because 3 < 4
[3, 4, 1, 2, 5]
    ^  ^ Swap
[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
       ^  ^ swap
[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
// 4 is now at its correct position because we reduced the length of the array
// We repeat this process until array is completely sorted

Before we sort, we must swap!
    - Many sorting algorithms involve some type of swapping functionality (e.g. swapping two numbers to put them in order)
// ES5
function swap(arr, inx1, inx2) {
    var temp = arr[idx1];
    arr[idx1] = arr[idx2];
    arr[idx2] = temp;
}; // This is more readable than ES6 but results in more lines of code.

// ES6 / ES2015
const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
}

BubbleSort PseudoCode
    - Start looping from with a variable called i at the end of the array towards the beginning
    - Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i-1
    - If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values!
    - Return the sorted array
