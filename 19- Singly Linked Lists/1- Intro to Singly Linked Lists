Singly Linked Lists

Objectives
    - Define what a Singly Linked List is
    - Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays
    - Implement insertion, removal, and traversal methids on Singly Linked Lists

What is a Linked List?
    - A data structure that containes a head, tail, and length property
    - Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

Head   Length = 4     Tail
  4  ->  6  ->  8  ->  2  ->
    Next   Next   Next   Null

Comparisons With Arrays
Lists
    - Do not have Indexes!
    - Connected via nodes with a next pointer
    - Random access is not allowed

Arrays
    - Indexed in order!
    - Insertion and deletion can be expensive
    - Can quickly be accessed at a specific Index
