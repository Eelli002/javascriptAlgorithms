Popping - Removing a node from the end of the Linked List!
    Because the nodes only point to the next node, if we remove the end we must loop through the list and make the second to last item the new tail.

    traverse() {
        var current = this.head;
        while(current) {
            console.log(current.val);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    Popping psuedocode
        - If there are no nodes in the list, return undefined
        - Loop through the list until you reach the tail
        - Set the next property of the 2nd to last node to be null
        - Set the tail to be the 2nd to last node
        - Decrement the length of the list by 1
        - Return the value of the node removed
