Multiple Pointers
    - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition.
    - Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

An example:
Write a function called sumZero wich accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
    - In order for multiple pointers to work, the array or string must be sorted.


create two pointers or variables at a set point in an array and adjust either of them based on a condition.

Naive Solution:
function sumZero(arr) {
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if(arr[i] + arr[j] === 0) {
                return [arr[i], arr[j]];
            }
        }
    }
}

example: [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5] looking for a pair that adds up to zero
// set pointers at -4 and 5.
// since -4 + 5 = 1, it is larger than zero so we keep the -4 pointer and move the 5 pointer to the left.
// since -4 + 2 = -2, it is smaller than zero so we move the -4 pointer to the right and keep the 2 pointer.
// since -3 + 2 = -1, it is still too small so we move the -3 pointer to the right again and keep the 2 pointer.
// since -2 + 2 = 0, we have found our solution.

function sumZero(arr) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    while(left < right) {
        let sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if(sum === 0) {
            return [arr[left], arr[right]];
        } else if (sum > 0) {
            right--;
        } else {
            left++;
        }
    }
}
time complexity = O(n)
space complexity = O(1)
