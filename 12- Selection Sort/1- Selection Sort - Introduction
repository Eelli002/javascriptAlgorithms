Selection sort
    - Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it plaves small values into sorted position.

First we mark index [0] as our position for the smallest number
[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^  ^ // Here we mark 3 as our temporary smallest number to replace with index[0]

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^     ^ // 4 is > than 3 so we move on

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^        ^ // We hit a number than is < than our temporary smallest (3) and mark it to be swapped with index[0]

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^           ^ // We finally hit the last number in the array and see that it is > than our temp smallest (1) so we do not change the temp value (1).

[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
// We now move the swapping position of the next number up or else we will forever be stuck with 1 as smallest and never alter afterwards.

[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
    ^  ^ // 3 is < than 4 so move on

[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
    ^        ^ // here we hit both the end of the array and the smallest number so we swap index[1] with the index of the new smallest number

[1, 2, 4, 5, 3] // We repeat this until our first loop completes.

We can reuse the swap code from the bubble sort function.

Selection Sort PseudoCode
    - Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
    - Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number
    - If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new 'minimum' and continue until the end of the array.
    - If the 'minimum' is not the value (index) you intially began with, swap the two values.
    - Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
