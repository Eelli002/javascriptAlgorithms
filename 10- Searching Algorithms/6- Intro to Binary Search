Binary Search
    - Binary search is a much faster form of search
    - Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
    - Binary search only works on sorted arrays!

Divide and Conquer
Lets search for 15:
[ 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
  ^                 ^                        ^
  Left           Too Small                 Right
  
// Start at the middle: 11
// if middle is smaller than 15, reassign left at 12
// else if middle is bigger than 15, reassign right at 9
// else if 11 === 15 we found it in O(1) time complexity
// repeat this process until middle is the value or the range is 3.
