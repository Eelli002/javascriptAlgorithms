Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

Why Learn This?
    - The sorting Algorithms we've learned so fat don't scale well
    - Try out bubble sort on an array of 100,000 elements, it will take some time!

Faster Sorts
    - There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
    - There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
    - The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
