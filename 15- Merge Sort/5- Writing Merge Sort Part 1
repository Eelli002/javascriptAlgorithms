mergeSort Pseudocode
    - Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element
    // Use recursion to keep breaking up the array into halves until we reach our base case which is having arrays of length 1 or 0.
    - Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array.
    - Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged (and sorted!) array.
