Quick Sort
    - Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
    - Works by selecting one elemtne (called the 'pivot') and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array.
    // move all elements less than the selected element to the left of it and all the elements greater than it to the right.
    // All elements on the left will be sorted in the same fashion and then the right will do the same.
    - Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be apploed on either side of the pivot.

How Does it Work?
[5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 7, 6, 3]
 ^
             5
[3, 2, 1, 4, ^, 7, 6, 8]

[3, 2, 1, 4]
 ^
       3
[2, 1, ^, 4]

[2, 1]
 ^
    2
[1, ^]

// Now the right
[7, 6, 8]
 ^
    7
[6, ^, 8]

// Should create a tree like stucture
             5
        3        7
    1     4    6    8
