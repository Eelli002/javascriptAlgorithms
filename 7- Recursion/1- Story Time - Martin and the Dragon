Martin has an array of numbers and wants to know if the items are even or odd.
[1288, 1982, 2386, 2038]

He goes to a magical dragon to ask if they are even or odd but the dragon will only tell him if the first number in the array is even or odd.

So Martin asks him 'is the first number in [1288, 1982, 2386, 2038] even or odd?'

The Dragon says even.

So Martin asks ' is the first number in [1982, 2386, 2038] even or odd?'

The Dragon replies even.

So Martin asks ' is the first number in [2386, 2038] even or odd?'

Dragon says even.

So Martin asks ' is the first number in [] even or odd?'

Dragon replies there is no number in the array. But I see you know about recursion.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recursion is taking one problem and doing it over and over on a smaller piece or a changing piece until you hit some end point called the base case.

Objectives
    - Define what recursion is and how it can be used.
    - Understand the two essential components of a recursive function.
    - Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions.
    - Use helper method recursion and pur recursion to solve more difficult problems.
