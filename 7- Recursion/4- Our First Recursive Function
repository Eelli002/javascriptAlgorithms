How recursive functions work?
    - Invoke the SAME function with a different input until you reach your base case!

Base Case
    - The condition when the recursion ends.
    - This is the most important concept to understand
    - If you do not have a base case to your recursive function you get stuck in an infinite loop

Two Essential parts of a recursive function!
    - Base Case
    - Different input, the new input that the function calls to solve the previous one.

Our First Recursive function

function countDown(num) {
    if (num <= 0) {
        console.log('All Done!)
        return;
    }
    console.log(num);
    num--;
    countDown(num);
}

Same Function Iteratively:
function countDown(num) {
    for (let i = num; i > 0; i--) {
        console.log(i)
    }
    console.log('All Done!')
}
