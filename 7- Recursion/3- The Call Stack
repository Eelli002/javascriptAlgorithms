Let's talk about functions
    - In almost all programming languages there is a built in data structure that manages what happends when fucntions are invoked
    - It's named the call stack!

The Call stack
    - It's a stack data structure - we'll talk about that later!
    - Any time a function is invoked it is places (pushed) on the top of the call stack
    - When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compler will remove(pop)

Why do I care?
    - You're used to functions being pushed on the call stack and popped off when they are done.
    - When we write recursive functions, we keep pushing new functions onto the call stack!
