Where things go wrong
    - No base case
    - Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing!
    - Stack Overflow!, when you don't have either of these two things the stack fills up.

function factorial(num) {
    if (num === 1) return 1;
    return num * factorial(num);
}

function factorial(num) {
    if (num === 1) console.log(1);
    return num * factorial (num - 1);
}
