What is Recursion?
    A PROCESS (a function in our case) that CALLS ITSELF.

It's EVERYWHERE
    - JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
    - document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
    - Object traversal
    - We will see it with more complex data structures
    - It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
