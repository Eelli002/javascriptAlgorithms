Objects - Unordered, key value pairs.

When to use objects:
    - When you don't need order
    - When you need fast access / insertion and removal

Big O of Objects:
    - Insertion: O(1)
    - Removal: O(1)
    - Searching: O(n)
    - Access: O(1)
When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice!

let instructor = {
    firstName: "Kelly",
    isInstructor: true,
    favoriteNumbers: [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
there is no order to objects, so you cannot add or remove from the beginning or end so it does not matter where you insert. You use a key.

When we search it is in, it is looking for the value in a key

Big O Object Methods:
    - Object.keys: O(n)
    - Object.values: O(n)
    - Object.entries: O(n)
    - hasOwnProperty: O(1)

    Object.keys(instructor) === ['firstName', 'isInstructor', 'favoriteNumbers']
    Object.entries(instructor) === ['firstName', 'Kelly'] ['isInstructor', true] ['favoriteNumbers', Array(4)]
    Object.hasOwnProperty('firstName') === true
