Big O Notation - Counting Operations
--------------------------------------

If not time, then what?
    - Rather than counting seconds, which are so variable...
    - Let's count the number of simple operations the computer has to perform!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Counting Operations:

function addUpTo(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
This problem has: 1 multiplication, 1 addition, 1 division operations, so 3 simple operations, regardless of the size of n.

function addUpTo(n) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total;
};
This problem has:
1 assignment at let total = 0;
1 assignment at let 1 = 0;
n comparisons at i <= n;
n additions and n assignments at i++;
n additions and n assignments at total += i;

so the amount of operations can be hard with these sorts of solutions because:
    - Depending on what we count, the number of operations can be as low as 2n or as high as 5n +2.
    - But regardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly proportionally with n.
