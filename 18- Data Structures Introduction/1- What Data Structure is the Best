Data Structures Introduction

What Do They Do?
    - Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Why So Many?
    - Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialozed, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

Why Care?
    - The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures.
    - You've already worked with many of them unkowingly!
    - And of course.. Interviews

There is no one 'BEST' data structure, they all excel in different situations...
    - Working with map/location data? Use a graph!
    - Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? Use a linked list!
    - Web scraping nested HTML? Use a tree!
    - Need to write a scheduler? Use a binary heap!
