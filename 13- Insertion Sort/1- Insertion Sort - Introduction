Insertion Sort
Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted

[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
 ^  ^ // Start at the second element (3) and compare it with the first element, if smaller swap.

[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]
    ^  ^ // Move up and compare again

[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
       ^  ^ // Again if smaller swap, but with this algo keep swapping until the element you are comparing is smaller than the one to the left of it.
// In this case 1 wouldn't just swap with 5, but it would continue to compare until in the correct position. So swap again with 4 and once more with 3.

[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
          ^  ^ // Repeat this until completely sorted
        
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Insertion Sort Psuedocode
    - Start by picking the second element in the array
    - Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary
    - Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e. the left side) to place the element in the correct place
    - Repeat until the array is sorted
