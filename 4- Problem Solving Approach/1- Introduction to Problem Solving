Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

Objectives
    - Define what an algorithm is
    - Devise a plan to solve Algorithms
    - Compare and Contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

What is an Alogorithm?
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

Why do you need to know this?
    - Almost everything that you do in progreamming involves some kind of Algorithm
    - It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer

How do you improve?
    - Devise a plan for solving problems
    - Master common problem solving patterns

Problem Solving
    - Understand the Problem
    - Explore Concrete Examples
    - Break it down
    - Solve /  Simplify
    - Look back and refactor
