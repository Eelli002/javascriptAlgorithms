Understanding the Problem
    - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    - What are the inputs what go into the problem?
    - What are the outputs that should come form the solution to the problem?
    - Can the outputs be determined from the outputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this 
      question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
    - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Example: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum?
    - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
        -- Take two numbers in and add them together
    - What are the inputs what go into the problem?
        -- The two numbers
    - What are the outputs that should come form the solution to the problem?
        -- The output should be the sum of the two inputs
    - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this 
      question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
        -- Yes, if you have two inputs then you can return the output
    - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
        -- The function 'sum', The two arguements, the sum of them returned.
