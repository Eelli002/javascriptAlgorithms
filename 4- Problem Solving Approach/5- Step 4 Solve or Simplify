Solve or Simplify

Simplify
    - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution
    - Then incorporate that difficulty back in

Example: Write a fuction which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.
