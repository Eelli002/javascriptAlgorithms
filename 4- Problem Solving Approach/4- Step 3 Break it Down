Break it Down
    - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take
    - This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in an dhave to worry about details.

Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

function charCount(str) {
    // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; caps dont matter
}

function charCount(str) {
    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string
    // return at end
}

function charCount(str) {
    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string, for each character
        // if the char is a number / char AND is a key in object, add one to count.
        // if the char is  a number / char AND is not in object, add it and set value to 1.
        // if the char is NOT a number / char don't do anything.
    // return at end
}
